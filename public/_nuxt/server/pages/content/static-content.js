(“Dribbble”, “we”, “our” or “us”).\n      Please read the Terms carefully before using the Service. If you don’t\n      agree to the Terms, as well as Dribbble’s Privacy Policy (the “Privacy\n      Policy”) and Dribbble’s Community Guidelines (the “Community\n      Guidelines”), you may not use the Service. If you are entering into the\n      Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that\n      you have the authority to bind such entity to the Terms. If you do not\n      have such authority, you must not accept the Terms or use the Service on\n      behalf of such entity. The Service is only available to you if you have\n      entered the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence and are\n      fully able and competent to enter into, abide by and comply with the\n      Terms. Your Dribbble Account. If you create an account on the Service\n      (your “Account”), you are responsible for maintaining the security of\n      your Account and its Content (as defined below), and you are fully\n      responsible for all activities that occur under your Account and any\n      other actions taken on the Service. You must not describe or assign\n      Content to your Account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in\n      a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and\n      Dribbble may change or remove any description or keyword that it\n      considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause\n      Dribbble liability. You must immediately notify Dribbble of any\n      unauthorized uses of your Account or any other breaches of security.\n      Dribbble will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including\n      any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.\n      For paid Accounts (each, a “Paid Account”), Dribbble deems the person\n      under whose name appears on the credit or charge card or other payment\n      method that pays the charges for the Service to be the owner of the Paid\n      Account. If a corporate or other organization’s name appears on the\n      credit or charge card or other pa yment method, that corporation or\n      organization is deemed to be the owner. If any dispute arises as to who\n      owns or controls a Paid Account, your most recently provided payment\n      method will continue to be charged and you will be responsible to pay\n      for the Service until Dribbble receives written confirmation from the\n      Paid Account email address confirming a change in ownership and control\n      of the Paid Account. Fees and Renewals. Pricing for Paid Accounts will\n      be provided at the time of purchase. Unless otherwise set out at the\n      time of purchase or as agreed to by Dribbble, fees for a Paid Account\n      will be billed in advance for each year and are non-refundable. There\n      will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service or for\n      periods in which your Paid Account remains open but you do not use the\n      Service. We reserve the right to modify our billing rates at any time\n      upon thirty (30) days written notice by posting such fee changes to the\n      Service or through email notification to you. You will be liable to pay\n      such modified billing rates. Subject to your payment of applicable fees\n      for a Paid Account, we will provide the Service to you for the period of\n      time that you have paid for such Service (the “Subscription Period”). At\n      the end of the Subscription Period, your Paid Account subscription will\n      automatically renew for an additional Subscription Period until it is\n      expressly cancelled by you as described in the “Termination” section\n      below. If you purchase any fee-based Service, you agree that our third\n      party payment gateways, such as Stripe and Paypal, may store your credit\n      or charge card or other payment information. You expressly agree that we\n      are authorized to charge you (i) a fee for any applicable Service for\n      which you have subscribed, billed on a basis of the Subscription Period,\n      (ii) any other fees for the Service you may purchase, (iii) any charges\n      for use of the Service in excess of the usage or other limits placed on\n      your use of the Service (and you hereby consent to such charges and\n      agree we are not required to notify you of any such charge in advance)\n      and (iv) any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Service\n      to the credit or charge card you provide and to reimburse us for all\n      collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts.

You take full responsibility for all taxes and fees of\n      any nature associated with the Service, including any sales tax related\n      to any purchase or sale of services or goods under the Terms.
