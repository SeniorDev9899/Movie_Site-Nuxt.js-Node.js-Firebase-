    <p class="text-sm">
      Millie Bobby Brown (born 19 February 2004) is an English actress and
      producer. She was born in Spain, to British parents. They moved to
      Orlando, Florida in 2011, where Millie went to acting workshops to pass
      the time on a Saturday, and it was there that a top Hollywood talent scout
      called and told Millie's parents that "she has instincts you cannot
      teach." She advised Millie's parents that Millie could "mix it with the
      best kids in Hollywood." They packed up and drove from Orlando to Los
      Angeles, and within a week, Millie was meeting with the town's top
      children's talent agencies. She was offered representation by all the
      agents that she met. Within three months of being in Hollywood, Millie was
      offered the role of young Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland.
      In November 2013, after just one self-taped audition, and without meeting
      the producers/directors, Millie was offered the role of Madison O'Donnell
      in BBC America's show, "Intruders."
